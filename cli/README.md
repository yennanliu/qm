# `qm`

The standalone deployment CLI for QM. The normative directory schema,
security guarantees, target behavior, and lifecycle are in
[`docs/deploy-directory.md`](../docs/deploy-directory.md). `qm init` materializes
the agent-consumable package runbook into the deployment repository.

```bash
npm exec --yes --package=@yc-software/qm@latest -- \
  qm init . --org acme --target aws
npm install
npm exec qm -- check
npm exec qm -- infra render
npm exec qm -- doctor
npm exec qm -- infra build-image
npm exec qm -- plan
npm exec qm -- up --yes
npm exec qm -- check --live
```

This package is published to npm as `@yc-software/qm`, with npm provenance attesting the
building workflow. A release is one dispatch of `.github/workflows/release.yml` from
`main`: it signs and pushes the first-party images, publishes the package pinning their
digests, and then tags `v<version>` and creates the GitHub release with the resolved
digests attached. Each release picks its own version: a patch bump past the latest released version, or
`cli/package.json`'s version when a PR raised it higher (for a minor or major bump); a
tag that already exists stops the release rather than moving. The checked-in image manifest is a sentinel that
a deployment overrides with real digests. The packed-artifact test exercises the consumer
path locally.

The CLI deploys long-running QM services; it is not the runtime. Docker runs
them locally, Fly runs them as Fly apps with Fly Machines for agent computers, and AWS
runs digest-pinned ARM64 tasks on ECS Fargate with Lambda MicroVM agent computers.

## Deployment directory

```text
qm.config.jsonc
package.json
package-lock.json
deployment.md
.codex/skills/deploy-qm/
.env.example
.env
slack-app-manifest.yml
slack-sso-manifest.yml
sandbox/
  tools/<id>/tool.json
  tools/<id>/<binary>
  skills/<id>/SKILL.md
  Dockerfile
plugins/<name>/Dockerfile
infra/
```

`qm.config.jsonc` is committed and contains no secret values. `.env` is ignored.
`package.json` pins the CLI package at the exact version that scaffolded the
directory — `contract: 1` is only the compatibility floor — so every checkout
resolves the same interpreter; upgrade the pin deliberately.
`cd` into it and the DEPLOY commands act on it; `--config` / `--env-file` / `--sandbox-dir` relocate
a piece (e.g. several deployments sharing one `sandbox/`). `check` validates the config,
computed secret names, tools, skills, and plugins without network access; `up`, `plan`, and
`sandbox build` run the same checks first. `doctor` verifies external prerequisites read-only.
`plan` renders the deployment; AWS mutation requires `up --yes`.

For a single-host Docker deployment, `sandbox.backend: "local"` runs each agent
computer in its own container. `qm up` builds the local runtime from the CLI's
pinned sandbox base, mounts the host Docker socket into trusted core, and connects
core to each sandbox's private network. An explicit `sandbox.image` uses that
runnable local image instead.

On AWS, `up` verifies under the deploy lease that RDS point-in-time recovery
is current (its `LatestRestorableTime` must lag by at most
`QM_AWS_DB_MAX_RESTORE_LAG_MS`, default 10 minutes) and records the pre-deploy
timestamp in the deployment manifest it precedes. `rollback` restores code and
configuration only, so it prints that timestamp as the matching data restore
point (`aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time`);
`aws.predeployDbSnapshot: false` opts out.

`sandbox build` is a local validation build of the sandbox layer image. At runtime
sandboxes boot their platform's stock image; tools and skills arrive through the
deployment-layer sync, which every ordinary `up` performs.

Auto uses its built-in model classifier unless `qm.config.jsonc` declares one
`securityScreen` proxy with a provider label, HTTPS endpoint, and `shadow` or
`enforce` rollout. The proxy token is routed separately through
`secretEnv.core.SECURITY_SCREEN_PROXY_TOKEN`.

## Administrator login without email

After deployment, run `qm admin-login` to print a single-use login URL valid for
five minutes. Open it and confirm the displayed administrator email. The command
uses the deployment's existing `PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET` and the email in
`ADMIN_GRANTS`; if several admins are configured, select one with `--email`.
QM checks that the selected account still has `org_admin` access when the link
is redeemed. The command creates no account or role grant.

Run it from the deployment directory with its `.env`, or use `--config` and
`--env-file`. Inside a running deployment without a config file, supply
`PORTAL_PUBLIC_URL`, `PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET`, and `ADMIN_GRANTS` through its
environment. The CLI prints only the URL, which is a temporary login credential;
do not publish it or put it in shared logs.

`qm setup` offers email setup separately. Skip it to use administrator login
without Resend or SMTP. To enable ordinary email login later, rerun `qm setup`
and configure the selected transport's complete credential set and sender,
then push secrets and redeploy. Missing email credentials disable email sign-in;
QM and `qm admin-login` remain available, even if a sender is still configured.

Deployment commands accept `--config`, `--env-file`, and `--sandbox-dir`;
`admin-login` uses only `--config` and `--env-file`. `dev` remains
the contributor worktree loop and is separate from the portable deployment contract.

## Package contract

The `@yc-software/qm/contract` export is the supported programmatic surface for
conformance tests. It exposes the contract version, parsing/rendering
functions, and provider ids without registering arbitrary runtime plugins.
Incompatible directory
changes increment the contract major; optional fields may be added within a
major.

The package has no runtime dependencies. It shells out to Docker with Buildx, Flyctl,
the AWS CLI, and Git. Terraform is operator-run against the module generated by `init`.
