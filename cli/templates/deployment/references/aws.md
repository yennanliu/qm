# AWS deployment

Use this after the choices and billing confirmation in `deployment.md`.
Terraform state, credentials, and every resource must belong to the operator.

## Preflight

Require Terraform, Docker, authenticated AWS credentials, two available AZs,
and AWS CLI support for Lambda MicroVMs:

```bash
aws --profile <profile> sts get-caller-identity
aws --profile <profile> ec2 describe-availability-zones --region <region> \
  --filters Name=state,Values=available
aws --profile <profile> lambda-microvms list-microvm-images --region <region>
terraform version
docker buildx version
```

If Lambda MicroVMs are unavailable, stop before mutation and offer Fly.io. Set
the account, region, service coordinates, and an operator-owned GitHub
repository and exact branch in the generated config and Terraform variables.
Never trust the upstream QM repository.

The account must permit the selected RDS class and backup retention in the
configured region and account plan. Set `aws.dbInstanceClass` before
`qm infra render` to override the `db.t4g.small` default. Set
`db_backup_retention_days` in `infra/terraform.tfvars` to override the 35-day
retention default. `aws.dbRetentionMinDays` only sets the minimum that `qm up`
accepts during its restore-point check and does not configure RDS.
Confirm all other billable AWS resources separately; this deployment does not
promise whole-stack free-tier compatibility.

Upgrading the CLI does not update an existing deployment's vendored Terraform.
Before setting `aws.dbInstanceClass`, preserve all local Terraform and tfvars
customizations, add this variable to `infra/variables.tf`, and change only the
RDS `instance_class` assignment in `infra/main.tf` to
`instance_class = var.db_instance_class`:

```hcl
variable "db_instance_class" {
  type    = string
  default = "db.t4g.small"
  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^db\\.[a-z0-9]+\\.[a-z0-9]+$", var.db_instance_class))
    error_message = "db_instance_class must be a valid RDS DB instance class such as db.t4g.small"
  }
}
```

Then run `qm infra render` and review the Terraform plan before applying.

Configure a private encrypted Terraform backend, then:

```bash
npm exec qm -- infra render
terraform -chdir=infra init
terraform -chdir=infra plan -out=qm.tfplan
terraform -chdir=infra apply qm.tfplan
```

Set `publicUrl`, `env.core.AWS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN_URL`, and `aws.deployRoleArn` from
the Terraform outputs. Finish `npm exec qm -- setup .`, render again, and apply.

## Publish the agent computer and deploy

```bash
npm exec qm -- infra build-image
npm exec qm -- check
npm exec qm -- secrets push
npm exec qm -- doctor
npm exec qm -- plan
npm exec qm -- up --yes
npm exec qm -- check --live
```

Existing deployments created before private session canaries must rerun
`npm exec qm -- infra render`, review the Terraform plan, and apply it with
infrastructure-administrator credentials before enabling `check --live`. This
adds the deploy role's stack-scoped permission to run and inspect the one-off
core canary task.

The package image manifest supplies first-party control-plane images. The AWS
backend transfers them into deployment-owned ECR and records immutable digests.
After the first successful deployment, rerun `npm exec qm -- up --yes` and
confirm it reconciles the same stack.

## Agent-computer proof

Copy the exact personal scope id shown for the signed-in administrator in
Admin, then derive the same opaque storage key as the runtime and read only the
proof file from the deployment-owned S3 home snapshot:

```bash
scope_id='personal:<exact-admin-principal>'
scope_key="$(npm exec qm -- proof scope-key "$scope_id")"
bucket="$(terraform -chdir=infra output -raw object_store_bucket)"
aws --profile <profile> --region <region> s3 cp \
  "s3://$bucket/sandbox-home/$scope_key.tar" - |
  tar -xOf - workspace/qm-computer-proof.txt
```

Require the output to match the UUID created in the browser. A missing or
ambiguous scope, snapshot, or file is a failed proof.

Routine operations:

```bash
npm exec qm -- status
npm exec qm -- logs core --follow
npm exec qm -- rollback --to <release-label-or-manifest-id>
npm exec qm -- down
```

Terraform destroy is separate and destructive. Decide how to retain RDS
snapshots, S3 objects, and secrets before following the generated `AGENTS.md`
teardown section.
