# PostgreSQL connection ownership

Ordinary queries, including the pg-boss cron queue, share the process-wide query pool for a database URL. When DATABASE_POOL_URL is configured, these queries use transaction pooling. Queue shutdown releases its pool reference without closing other stores' connections. Queue migrations retain pg-boss's single-call transaction boundaries.

Notification subscriptions share one direct connection per database URL per process. Session state, ledger events, run signals, and run streaming register their channels on that connection. Closing a consumer removes its subscription; the last unsubscribe closes the listener. Reconnection restores the active channel set before notifying consumers to resynchronize from durable state. Notifications remain wake-up hints, not durable storage.

Session advisory locks and leader leases continue to use direct session connections. Query pool sizes, PgBouncer backend limits, and database placement are unchanged. Multiple processes and separate company databases still have separate listeners and pools.

Validate notification delivery, reconnection, and teardown with test/postgres-listener.test.ts against a disposable DATABASE_URL. The race and queue lifecycle tests run with the standard module-mocking test command. scripts/test-pgbouncer.sh exercises queue startup, execution, shutdown, and restart through a one-backend transaction pool.

This removes three notification connections when all four channels are in use, plus pg-boss's independent query pool. It does not promise a fixed total connection count: active queries, session locks, deployment overlap, and pooler replicas still determine server usage.
