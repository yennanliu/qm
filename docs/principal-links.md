# Principal links

A person can reach qm through several sign-ins: a Slack account, an email
magic link, or a trusted OIDC provider. Each produces its own principal id
(`jordan@acme.test`, `U0JORDAN`, `oidc:<issuer-hash>:<subject>`). Without a
link, qm treats them as different people: a credential dropped from Slack is
owned by the email principal, and the same founder signed in through OIDC is
told the link is for someone else.

A **principal link** records that two principal ids are one person. One id is
the **canonical principal**; the other is a **linked sign-in**. Every
same-person check in core (`personKey`, `samePerson`) folds a linked sign-in to
its canonical principal, so ownership of credentials, admin grants, sessions,
approvals, and secret drops recorded under either id belongs to the person.
New writes use the canonical id: the identity service classifies a linked
sign-in as its canonical principal, the portal resolves the session subject
before proxying, and the keychain stores credentials under the canonical owner.

## Rules

- **Administrative links keep the directory member canonical.** When the company runs Slack, the
  Slack-verified directory principal is the person's canonical id and the
  trusted OIDC subject is the linked sign-in. The admin API refuses a link
  whose linked side is a directory member, by principal id or Slack id.
- **A link never creates an admin.** A sign-in that holds an org admin grant
  can only be linked to a canonical principal that is already an admin.
- **Links are flat.** A canonical principal is never itself linked onward, and
  a linked sign-in cannot become canonical for others.
- **Evidence is required.** Every link records how the two identities were
  verified as one person and which admin created it.
- **Links are reversible.** Deleting a link restores two separate principals.
  Records written while the link existed stay under the canonical id, so a
  wrong link is an incident to reconcile, not just a row to delete.
- **Deactivation follows the person.** Deactivating either id deactivates both.

## Admin API

Org admins manage links through the admin surface; the agent cannot.

```
GET    /v1/admin/principal-links
POST   /v1/admin/principal-links      { principalId, canonicalId, evidence }
DELETE /v1/admin/principal-links/:principalId
```

Surfaces resolve a sign-in with a source-authenticated read:

```
GET /v1/principals/:id/canonical   → { principalId, canonicalId }
```

The portal caches the answer for one minute and refuses to proxy (503) when
core cannot answer, rather than acting as the unresolved subject. A deleted
link therefore stays effective for at most a minute of cached sessions.

Links live in the `principal_links` durable map of the company database.

## Self-service Slack linking

The dedicated Connect Slack flow preserves the signed-in web principal as canonical, keeping its existing connector ownership. Completion verifies a short-lived signed ticket, Composio account ownership, Slack user identity, and the installed company workspace before linking the directory member. Existing credentials or Composio accounts on the Slack principal require support instead of being silently stranded. Email similarity is not proof of identity.
