name: dev-instance
description: Run the current worktree as a production-shaped local dev instance — core, Slack, web UI, admin, portal, on a real Pi LLM + Postgres — reachable in Slack as your own bot. Each developer uses their own set of Slack apps from their own machine's pool store, so many worktrees (yours and a teammate's) can run reachable at once without colliding. Use when asked to /dev-instance, "spin this up so I can QA it in Slack", or "let me test your branch end to end".

# dev-instance

`dev-instance` runs the current worktree as a full, production-shaped stack on your
machine and makes it reachable in Slack as one of _your_ bots. It is the way to QA a
branch end to end: real LLM turns, a real sandbox, a real local Postgres (empty by
default; opt in to prod data), and the real Slack/web/admin surfaces.

Use the repo-root launcher (a thin wrapper over the TypeScript CLI in `scripts/dev/`;
every command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output):

```bash
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh up
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh status
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh down
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh doctor
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh canary
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh restart [child]
bash scripts/dev-instance.sh logs [child] [-f]
```

`npm run dev-instance`, `npm run dev-instance:status`, `npm run dev-instance:down`, and
`npm run dev-instance:doctor` are equivalent. The Codex-visible skill copy lives at
`.codex/skills/dev-instance/SKILL.md`; keep the two skill descriptions equivalent.

## What `up` Starts

`up` claims one free Slack app slot from **this machine's** pool store (see "Slack reach"
below), then spawns a **per-slot supervisor daemon** that owns the production-shaped stack:

- core API + workers
- Slack Socket Mode plugin (connected as the claimed app's bot)
- web UI surface
- admin surface
- portal front door proxying `/web-ui/` and `/admin/`

The supervisor restarts crashed children with backoff, waits for a port to actually free
before respawning (no more EADDRINUSE), health-probes everything every 10s, and writes a
heartbeat so slot reclaim can tell "actively in use" from "abandoned".

**`up` only prints success after proving the bot is reachable**: the Slack socket must be
the app's _only_ connection (`num_connections == 1`, read from the hello frame) and — when
the slot has a `CANARY_CHANNEL` — a posted canary message must arrive back over that same
socket. If Slack reports multiple connections, `up` flags the slot for 30 minutes and
auto-rotates to the next one. The count is a snapshot from the last hello frame, not
a continuously refreshed inventory. Its `debug_info.host` identifies Slack's server,
not another client's machine; it cannot locate a competing instance. A canary that
never returns leaves delivery unverified; `up` flags and rotates past that too.

**Re-running `up` on a live instance is a reload, not a no-op**: it re-reads your shell
env, dev.env, and `.env`, diffs against what the children are running, and does a rolling
restart + re-verification when anything changed (`--force` to restart regardless,
`--rotate` to move to a different Slack app).

Open the portal URL printed by the CLI. Direct web/admin URLs are also printed for
debugging, but the portal URL is the prod-like path.

## Sandbox: local Docker by default

The agent's `execute` sandbox runs as a **local Docker container** (`SANDBOX_BACKEND=local`)
when the worktree's code supports it — no cloud credential, no tunnel, no microVM cold
starts, and the sandbox reaches core's self-API at `host.docker.internal` directly. Build
the image once per machine with `npm run sandbox:local:build` (the CLI warns if it's
missing or stale). Use local Docker unless you are specifically testing the cloud path.

For prod-parity QA, pass `--sandbox <backend>` to run against your deployment's real
sandbox provider instead. That path validates the provider credential and opens a tunnel
so the remote sandbox can call back to your local core, so it needs whatever that provider
requires; the local backend needs nothing but Docker.

## Slack reach: your apps vs a teammate's

This is the part people get wrong, so it's worth stating plainly.

A Slack app's **Socket Mode** connection is single-owner: if two running instances point
at the _same_ app, Slack load-balances inbound messages between them and each instance
silently loses half. So the rule is **one live instance per Slack app**.

The way we keep out of each other's way is simple: **every developer has their own set of
Slack apps**, listed as `poolN.env` files in their **own machine's** pool store
(`~/.config/qm/slack-pool`). `up` claims the first free slot on _this_ machine and boots
that app's bot; the script prints its `@handle`. You QA by DMing that bot in
`example.slack.com`.

- **Your machine** (Alice's): the pool holds `pool1.env … pool10.env`, which are the apps
  `bot1 … bot10`. So up to 10 worktrees can run reachable at once here; each `up` grabs
  the next free slot, `down` frees it. DM whichever `@botN` the script printed.
- **A teammate's machine** (e.g. Carol's): a _different_ set of apps in _their_ local pool
  store. Their instances claim their apps; yours claim yours. You never collide, because you
  are never pointing at the same app — and there is no shared registry, no `#worktree`
  prefix, and no relay to coordinate. Each of you just DMs your own bot.

The per-machine pool lease (an atomic lock per slot) also stops two worktrees on the _same_
machine from grabbing the same slot. Before connecting, `up` sweeps the machine for
orphaned processes still holding the slot's Slack app token (e.g. a plugin another
worktree's teardown missed) and kills them. If every slot is taken, `up` reclaims one —
but **never a slot whose supervisor heartbeat is fresh**: an actively used instance can't
be stolen mid-QA; only dead/legacy leases fall back to the old not-today / 4-hour rule.

To add capacity, mint more Slack apps from `src/slack/manifest.json` (one Socket Mode
app each, with `connections:write` for the app-level token) and drop a `poolN.env`
containing `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (`xoxb-`), `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (`xapp-`), and `HANDLE` into your
pool store. The boot canary picks its channel automatically: a channel named `dev-canary`
if the bot is in one, else a `ci-*` throwaway it is in — never a human channel — and the
canary message is deleted right after it round-trips. `CANARY_CHANNEL=<channel id>` in the
slot env overrides. With no eligible channel at all, `up` prints `delivery unverified` (or
fails under `--strict`).

A forgotten instance cleans itself up: after 24 hours with no handled Slack turns,
interactions, reloads, or restarts, the supervisor tears itself down and frees the slot
on its next idle check (every 10 minutes). Ambient workspace events, health checks,
status reads, and canaries (including `dev doctor`) do not reset the timer. This is
an idle timeout, not a fixed 24-hour lifetime. It only retires instances running this
supervisor; extra connections on another host must be stopped on that host. `DEV_INSTANCE_IDLE_HOURS` overrides the timeout; `0` disables it.

## Real by Default

The dev instance should exercise the real system:

- real LLM: needs a model credential for the harness you run. Core supports several
  (`HARNESS=pi|opencode|codex|claude`); the launcher picks one from the credentials it
  finds and honours an explicit `HARNESS`. Set the key your chosen harness expects. For
  Codex, a ChatGPT OAuth session is also supported: `HARNESS=codex` discovers a valid
  `$HOME/.codex/auth.json`, or you can set `CODEX_AUTH_FILE` to another auth file. Core
  refreshes OAuth tokens centrally and hands the Codex child ephemeral material (no
  refresh token). Pass `DEV_INSTANCE_ALLOW_MOCK=1` for a deliberate no-model wiring
  check. The auth-file path is for local dev instances; deployed production processes
  use an API key or a keychain credential (`CODEX_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` /
  `CLAUDE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL`), whose secret lives encrypted in its owner's keychain.
- real durability: uses `DATABASE_URL` when supplied; otherwise starts/reuses a local
  Docker Postgres container and runs core with `SESSION_STORE=postgres` and
  `RUN_STORE=postgres`
- production data is never copied into a dev instance
- captured model context: request capture is on unless overridden, so you can read back what the model was actually sent
- fast local edits: runs Node surfaces with `--watch` and serves the web UI through
  Vite HMR on the dev surface instead of a separate browser build loop
- stale pool recovery: `status` shows each deploy's start time and age; if all pool
  apps are taken, `up` reclaims a slot not started today or older than 4 hours
- local admin seed: for a self-provisioned local DB, empty `admin_grants` are seeded
  from `DEV_INSTANCE_ADMIN_PRINCIPAL` or the local OS user; explicit `ADMIN_GRANTS`
  still wins
- local portal auth: the launcher sets a localhost-only portal auth bypass, signing in
  as `DEV_INSTANCE_ADMIN_PRINCIPAL`, the first `ADMIN_GRANTS` principal, the first
  durable `org_admin` in Postgres, or the local OS user. Production portal auth remains
  real OIDC.

Only use escape hatches for deliberate wiring checks — this is how you ask for _less_ than
the full real stack when a test doesn't need it:

```bash
DEV_INSTANCE_ALLOW_MOCK=1 bash scripts/dev-instance.sh up
DEV_INSTANCE_ALLOW_MEMORY=1 bash scripts/dev-instance.sh up
DEV_INSTANCE_WATCH=0 bash scripts/dev-instance.sh up
DEV_INSTANCE_RECLAIM_STALE=0 bash scripts/dev-instance.sh up
```

## Env Discovery

The launcher reads values from, in priority order: exported shell env, the machine-global
`~/.config/qm/dev.env`, your login shell (for a model credential exported there), and this
worktree's `.env` (seeded from the main checkout in linked worktrees). Slack pool tokens
default to `~/.config/qm/slack-pool`.

When a cloud sandbox backend is configured it also validates that provider's access at
startup, refreshes a stale provider token from the provider CLI's own logged-in session
where it can, and — if a tunnel binary is present — opens a quick tunnel so sandbox
self-API calls can reach your local core. None of that runs on the default local backend.

## After Startup

Report the slot, portal URL, Slack handle, and log directory. To test Slack-specific
behavior, DM the printed `@<handle>` (on Alice's machine that's one of `@bot1 … @bot10`)
in `example.slack.com`; for admin and web behavior, open the printed portal URL. Tear down
with `bash scripts/dev-instance.sh down` when QA is finished.

## Troubleshooting

**Start with `dev doctor` (or `doctor --json`).** It runs the checks that used to take a
debugging session by hand — socket exclusivity (`num_connections`), a live canary
round trip, env/git drift since boot, per-child health and restart counts, stale leases,
port squatters, machine-wide token orphans, Docker daemon — and prints a ranked diagnosis
with a remedy per finding. `doctor --fix` applies the safe ones (child restarts).

**Bot never replies to a DM (silent bot).** The new `up` catches the two big causes at
boot: multiple reported connections to the same app (flags the slot and auto-rotates)
and a Slack app whose events never arrive (canary fails → flags the slot and rotates).
Check local processes and other deployments before attributing a connection count to
a live competitor. After cleanup, reconnect to obtain a fresh hello count; rereading
health alone returns the previous snapshot. The 10s health probe logs
`DEGRADED: num_connections=N` in `supervisor.log` when it observes a count transition
above one, but cannot detect a new competitor while the hello snapshot is unchanged.
Periodic canaries can detect delivery loss; `dev canary` tests delivery on demand.
A successful canary does not establish exclusivity. `dev up --rotate` moves to a fresh slot.

For a slot flagged `canary-failed`, check networking, event subscriptions, permissions,
and competing connections first. If the app configuration needs rebuilding, use
api.slack.com **signed into the example workspace** (the dev console is
per-workspace-identity — use "Sign in to another workspace" if it lists the wrong one):
Create New App → From a manifest → paste `src/slack/manifest.json` (give it a unique
`name` and bot `display_name`; old handles stay taken) → Install to Workspace → Basic
Information → App-Level Tokens → Generate with the `connections:write` scope. Write the Bot
token (`xoxb-…`) and app-level token (`xapp-…`) into `poolN.env`, delete `poolN.flag.json`,
then run `up` again to verify the replacement. Reinstalling an existing app may also
resolve configuration drift; verify delivery afterward.

Two smaller gotchas: a freshly-created bot isn't in Slack's "New message" people search for a
minute or two — open its DM deterministically via `conversations.open` (bot token + your user
id) and navigate to `app.slack.com/client/<team-id>/<D-channel-id>`. And the browser's Slack
login drops easily during long automated sessions; re-authenticating is a Google SSO you have
to complete yourself.
