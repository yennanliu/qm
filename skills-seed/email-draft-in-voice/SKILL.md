# Draft email in the user's voice

Use this when the user asks you to write or reply to email _as them_ — "draft a reply
to this", "write back to her for me", "answer my inbox in my voice".

## Load the profile first — never freehand

Read `voice/email-voice-profile.md` from the workspace. If it doesn't exist, run the
`email-voice-profile` skill first (personal DM only) — do not improvise a voice from
memory or from this conversation's tone. The profile's **Hard rules** and
**Anti-patterns** sections are constraints, not suggestions.

## Draft

1. Read the full thread you're replying to through the selected email access skill —
   never draft from a snippet or excerpt; a question below the fold would go silently
   unanswered. Match the register the profile prescribes for this audience.
2. Write the body to a file — plain text, one line per paragraph, blank line between.
   Plain text only — never styled HTML (fonts, colors, buttons).
3. Self-check against the profile before showing anything: opener and sign-off drawn
   from their real ones, sentence rhythm right, no anti-pattern present. If a sentence
   could appear in anyone's email, rewrite it or cut it.
4. Show the user the exact text and ask for approval before creating any draft.

## Save the draft

Use the selected email access skill to create or update the Gmail draft, preserving
reply threading and recipients. Sending is a separate action and requires explicit
approval of the draft for sending.

## Afterward

Tell the user where the draft landed in Gmail Drafts and keep the draft id in the
workspace so it can be updated. If they edit your text, notice what they changed —
recurring corrections belong in the voice profile as hard rules; offer to add them.
