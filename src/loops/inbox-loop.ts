export function renderInboxSyncTask(loopId: string): string {
  return `Inbox sync v${INBOX_SYNC_TASK_VERSION}. Keep the user's QM inbox loop current: every Slack message and email genuinely WAITING ON A REPLY FROM THEM gets a ledger item with a ready-to-send draft in their own voice. The inbox UI is the only delivery surface — never message the user, and NEVER send a reply yourself; you produce drafts only.

1. GET $AGENT_API_URL/v1/loops/${loopId}/items (agent capability header) — note existing items: skip complete items already tracked unless a NEWER inbound message has arrived since (compare sourceAt); re-post such items with the fresh message and a fresh draft. Refresh an agent draft when sourceAt is newer than proposal.at, even if the ledger already contains the latest message; realtime updates refresh message data before drafting. Preserve human-edited drafts. Repair incomplete open items first: an existing dedupeKey with missing sourcePayload, title, snippet, source metadata, or proposal is unfinished work, not a reason to skip it. Re-read its original conversation using the dedupeKey and summary, then ingest the complete item and draft under that same dedupeKey even when no newer message arrived. Never invent message content from a summary; if the source is unavailable, leave the item pending for retry.
   - Closed-loop detection: BEFORE scanning for new items, re-read the exact source conversation of EVERY unresolved item (held, pending, processed, or failed), regardless of lastScanAt, age, read/unread state, or whether Gmail still labels it INBOX. The intake watermark is NOT a reconciliation watermark. If the LATEST message is FROM THE USER THEMSELVES — their own Slack userId on Slack, or their own email address in the From line on Gmail — they already replied outside QM, so POST $AGENT_API_URL/v1/loops/${loopId}/items/<itemId>/action with {"kind":"replied","args":{"text":"<their message, <=200 chars>","sourceAt":<reply timestamp in ms>}} to close it. Ignore Gmail drafts and recognize SENT messages, including send-as aliases. Only close when the reply is newer than the waiting message and there is no later inbound ask. If a source read fails or is incomplete, retain the item and retry later; do not treat it as resolved. This applies to both Gmail and Slack items. Do NOT reopen or redraft an item the user has already answered.
2. Keep a lastScanAt watermark in a state file on your workspace (e.g. ~/workspace/inbox-sync/STATE.md); scan each connected source since that watermark (fall back to ~3 days on first run), and advance the watermark only after a successful pass, so outages and missed fires backfill instead of leaving silent gaps. Skip a source whose app is not connected. Judge "waiting on a reply" like a good chief of staff, with a deliberate asymmetry: (a) NEEDS REPLY: direct questions, requests, intros, and personal messages that expect acknowledgment; when in any doubt, this bucket. (b) PROBABLY RESOLVED: the transcript reads closed (a thanks, a "sounds good", a thread someone else already answered) but a reasonable person might still send a word; post the item anyway with "probablyResolved": true in the item body and a draft included; the UI shows these in a muted section. NEVER silently drop a human conversation you judged resolved; demote it instead. (c) SKIP entirely: only unmistakable machine noise (newsletters, receipts, calendar notices, bot chatter). Human words never skip; the lowest they go is probablyResolved.
   - Gmail (use the google-workspace skill): INBOX threads where the LAST message is inbound and the user is in To or Cc. sourceKey = the Gmail threadId. Record gmail metadata: threadId, messageId, the RFC-2822 Message-ID header (rfcMessageId), subject, and the reply recipients (to = reply-all sender+others minus the user; cc as appropriate).
   - Slack (use your Slack access as the user): unanswered DMs, @mentions, and thread replies addressed to the user. ONE ITEM PER CONVERSATION, never per message: for unthreaded DMs and group DMs sourceKey = the channelId alone (two people posting in the same group DM is ONE item, refreshed with the latest state and a single draft answering everything outstanding); for all threaded asks sourceKey = channelId:threadTs (channelId:ts of a top-level message anchoring its own thread). Record slack metadata: channelId, channelLabel ("#channel" or "DM with <name>"), ts (the LATEST waiting message), isDirectMessage from Slack conversations.info is_im/is_mpim (NEVER infer group DMs from C/G ID prefixes), and threadTs for every threaded ask. For a top-level CHANNEL mention, threadTs is the original mentioned message ts, even before anyone replies. Preserve that anchor forever: unrelated channel chatter must not replace, refresh, or resolve this item. Read conversations.replies for that root, not the channel tail. For mentions inside a thread, include the root and only that thread. Relevant messages immediately before/after a channel mention may be included in context with nearby:true; never label these as thread replies, and never include unrelated neighboring messages.
3. For each new or refreshed item, investigate before drafting: read the whole thread, and check whatever context makes the reply substantive (calendar for scheduling asks, earlier email/Slack history for open questions). Draft the reply in the user's own voice — for email follow the email-draft-in-voice skill (build the voice profile first if it is missing); for Slack match how the user actually writes in Slack (check their recent messages: register, length, punctuation). Punctuation hard rule: never use em dashes or en dashes in a draft; use a comma, period, or "..." instead, and re-read every draft before posting to strip any that slipped in.
4. POST $AGENT_API_URL/v1/loops/${loopId}/items with {"items": [...]}. Each item: source ("gmail"|"slack"), sourceKey, title (subject or channel label), from (display name), fromDetail (address or @handle), snippet (the waiting message, <=200 chars), context (up to 6 prior thread messages as {author, at, text}), receivedAt (ms epoch of the waiting message), externalUrl (deep link to the original in Gmail/Slack), draft ({to, cc, subject, body} for gmail — body plain text; {body} for slack), and the gmail/slack metadata block from step 2. IMAGES: when a thread message carries image attachments, include an "images" array of their https URLs (Slack: url_private; up to 4) on the matching context entry, and on the item itself for the waiting message — the UI proxies and renders them inline as the user's own eyes would see them in Slack/Gmail.
5. Found nothing new and changed nothing? Finish silently. Only raise your voice on a real fault (a connector that errors repeatedly) — and then only briefly.`;
